
### Timing (Section 3.1)

> How many bytes of data must be transferred to read all three accelerometer axes?

> From your oscilloscope readings, roughly how long does one I2C transaction take when only the accelerometer is enabled?

> What is the maximum rate at which you can read the accelerometer? What limits the speed?

### Filtering (Section 3.2)

> What were your final selections for data rates and sensitivities? How did you decide on those values?

> What happens when you set kappa = 1 in your filter?

> What happens when you set kappa = 0 in your filter?

> What was your final choice for kappa? Why did you select that value?

### Challenge (Section 4)

> Draw out the relevant parts of the state machine for the ramp detection.

### Contributions

> Briefly describe each studentâ€™s contribution and participation for this lab. In addition, divide 100 points among the team members based on their individual contributions to the lab assignment. Each team member should be allocated a percentage of the total points earned by the team. This will allow us to evaluate the effort and participation of each team member in the assignment.
