# RBE 2002 Libraries

This folder contains the libraries that you will use both in weekly assignments and the final project. In general, you'll do development as a weekly assignment and then incorporate the (updated) libraries into your project code.

**Do not copy the files herein to other projects/directories!**

Instead, you can simply link to all of them in your `platformio.ini` file with a *relative* path, for example:

```
lib_extra_dirs = 
    ../../rbe2002-lib
```
