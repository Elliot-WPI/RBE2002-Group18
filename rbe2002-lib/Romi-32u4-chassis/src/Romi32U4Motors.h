/** \class Romi32U4Motor
 * Controls motor effort and direction on the Romi 32U4.
 *
 * This library uses Timer 1, so it will conflict with any other libraries using
 * that timer. 
 * 
 * Also reads counts from the encoders on the Romi 32U4.
 *
 * This class allows you to read counts from the encoders on the Romi 32U4,
 * which lets you tell how much each motor has turned and in what direction.
 *
 * The encoders are monitored in the background using interrupts, so your code
 * can perform other tasks without missing encoder counts.
