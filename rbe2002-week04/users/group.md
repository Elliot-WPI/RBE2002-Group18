> Before you get started coding, draw out a state machine for the navigation of the arena, keeping in mind that turning (being non-blocking) is a state. Be sure to label the transitions with events and actions.


> List out at least three methods you could use for executing turns. List the advantages and disadvantages of each.



Describe the method you will use to execute turns. Make a *positive statement* about why you chose that method. How can you mitigate the disadvantages?

Don't forget to create a release of your team's code.

> Briefly describe each studentâ€™s contribution and participation for this lab. In addition, divide 100 points among the team members based on their individual contributions to the lab as- signment. Each team member should be allocated a percentage of the total points earned by the team. This will allow us to evaluate the effort and participation of each team member in the assignment.
