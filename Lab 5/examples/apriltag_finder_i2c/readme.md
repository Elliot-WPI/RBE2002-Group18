Demonstrates communication with an Open MV camera using I2C.

Pair with `openmv_scripts/apriltags_i2c.py`.

See the pinout of the OpenMV camera in the root of this repo (go to https://openmv.io for other camera versions).

The OpenMV camera is both 3.3V and 5V tolerant -- no need for level shifters.

You can test with both devices powered by USB. To run headless, save the script as `main.py` (see the Tools menu in the OpenMV IDE).
