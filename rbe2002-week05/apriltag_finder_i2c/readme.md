Demonstrates communication with an Open MV camera using I2C.

Pair with `openmv_scripts/apriltags_i2c.py`.

See the pinout of the OpenMV camera at https://openmv.io.

The OpenMV camera is both 3.3V and 5V tolerant -- no need for level shifters.

You can test with both devices powered by USB. To run headless, save the script as `main.py` (see the Tools menu in the OpenMV IDE).
